  <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
    <p>
      When Verify sends a Response to your service it's already been through the so-called "Matching Process".
      As part of this process a bit of SAML is signed by your Matching Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that it's possible for us to test your service in isolation from your Matching Service you need
      to tell us a few things about it so we can  stub it's behaviour in the compliance tool.
